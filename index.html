          <h4>Exploring the Efficacy of Single and Combination Therapies Involving CDC27 and PI3K Inhibitors, with or without Cisplatin, in HPV-Positive and HPV-Negative Tonsillar and Base of Tongue Cancer Cell Lines</h4>
          <i class="date">3 months</i>
          <p>Human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) tonsillar and base of tongue cancer (TSCC/BOTSCC) accounting for 40% of all head neck cancer (HNSCC) in Sweden are still rising in incidence, and are despite their better outcome compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) HNSCC (80% vs. 50% resp. 5-year survival) treated like HNSCC with chemoradiotherapy (CRT)(1,2). CRT has severe side effects reducing the quality of life without improving the previously obtained efficacy of 80% 5- year survival with only radiotherapy (RT) given in the past, so new therapeutic options are urgently needed (3,4).Previous studies by us and others have focused on the identification of prognostic or targetable markers specific to HPV-related TSCC/BOTSCC.5 6 Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA) and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR3) mutations have for example frequently been found in HPV+ TSCC/BOTSCC, while also being associated with a poorer prognosis, while TP53 mutations dominate in HPV- TSCC/BOTSCC.7 8 Upon whole exome sequencing (WES) we identified additional potentially targetable genes, such as CDC27, where e.g. a deletion variant was identified in tumours and metastasis of patients with worse prognosis (9). Here, we want to in vitro on monolayer (2D) and spheroid (3D)TSCC/BOTSCC cell lines (the latter to better mimic in vivo conditions identify which available targeted therapies can potentially best be used for treatment of HPV+ and HPV- TSCC/BOTSCC.</p>

         <h4>Target validation for radiopharmaceutical therapy to treat high-risk neuroblastoma in children</h4>
          <i class="date">4 months</i>
          <p>Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumour in children, typically originating from immature nerve cells in the adrenal gland. NB has an early age of onset and a high frequency of metastasis, with bone marrow being the most frequent site of metastasis. Although NB is a radiosensitive tumour, radiotherapy becomes ineffective when cancer has metastasized because metastatic lesions are often undetectable for radiation delivery. Recent advances, including 177Lutetium-DOTATATE clinical trials, have shown promise for high-risk NB treatment. This study aims to validate the expression of new targets for RPT in NB samples.</p>

        <h4>Final year project - How can we use NK cells as a therapeutic approach to treat lung cancer?</h4>
          <i class="date">3 months</i>
          <p>Working under the guidance of Professor Hugh Brady, I undertook a final year project in the form of a research proposal aimed at designing a grant proposal for a 3-year research project. In this proposal, I outlined four work packages with the objective of developing alternative anti-tumour treatments for lung cancer that are more effective than current options.</br>
          To achieve this objective, my proposed research focused on understanding the biology of lung cancer and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. Additionally, I aimed to target NSCLC lung tumours and improve NK cell tumour infiltration and homing. To accomplish these goals, I designed a series of experiments using advanced techniques such as nucleofection, knockouts, overexpression, CAR constructs, lung cancer patient-derived organoids, and mRNA-seq.</br>
          By developing this grant proposal, I sought to make a meaningful contribution to the field of cancer research by exploring novel approaches to combating lung cancer. Through my proposed research, I hope to help pave the way towards more effective and efficient treatments for this devastating disease.</p>

        <h4>Is the overexpression of RRas2 a driver mechanism in the development of breast cancer?</h4>
          <i class="date">11 months</i>
          <p>During my time in the lab, I led a project investigating the correlation between overexpression of RRas2 protein (also known as TC21) and the development of breast cancer. To better understand this relationship, I utilized both mouse models and human breast tissues, as well as conducting in vitro experiments with 293T and BT-549 cell lines. One of the key aspects of my project was analyzing the C124G SNP in the 3'UTR region of the RRas2 gene, with the goal of identifying any links between this genetic variant and breast cancer.</p>
